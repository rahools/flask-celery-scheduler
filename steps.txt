Firstly, I'm trying to setup and run a RabbitMQ server on docker. RabbitMQ is a message queue service which will help with:
1. having a central job queue which other microservices can access for possibility for serverless application.
2. having fault torelance. If the worker crashes or dies without completing the task, task will stay in the queue triggering other worker have a crack at it.
3. 

the command that will run RabbitMQ on docker is:
# docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management

NOTE: username for the RabbitMQ web-portal at 'http://localhost:15672' is 'guest:guest'

### TO start a celery worker
# celery -A 'name of the file' worker --loglevel=info

for me it would be:
# celery -A task worker --loglevel=info
